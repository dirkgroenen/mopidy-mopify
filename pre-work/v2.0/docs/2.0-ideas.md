# V2.0 - Mopify -> Sonate
When I've first written Mopify it was nothing more than a simple copy cat of Spotify play. Mostly created as a learning project for myself. 

In January 2015 I released a new version: Mopify 1.0. This was a complete remake, built on Angular and with Spotify as main source in mind. 

After some time the client got more and more popular. At this point in time it's quite a popular client and many people have been requesting the support of more Mopidy extensions. So, after a few months I've decided to write a new version: 2.0. 

###The bloody name
One thing I've always been bothered with is the name. The name was picked when I first released the client. A simple mutation of Mopidy and Spotify resulted in Mopify. 

The name doesn't make sense anymore since I'm going to widen up the scope for the client. And beside that; the name sucks.

So I've decided to release Mopify 2.0 with a brand new name: **Sonate**.

# Menu structure
The current menu structure is quite resting on the Spotify implementation as main source. Although I don't want to change it to much, since It's working for me, I have to make some changes so we can have access to other music sources. 

Below I've written a comparison between the current en (possibly) next menu structure.

        + Mopidy
        + Sonate


# Collection
Sonate will have some big changes in the 'My Music' section. To support the multiple sources. and browsing in between them, I'm going to add a horizontal column based navigation. 

## Browse
The browse section will contain all enabled sources. Here you can navigate through for example SoundCloud, LocalFiles and Spotify. 

It's possible to add a shortcut to a directory or subdirectory to the navigation.

**Examples (quickly drawn)**

# Help
Mopify/Sonate is a project I've started because I wanted a better player. I've noticed more people using, and liking, it which brings me to releasing a new version. 

As of most things in life: I can't do it all myself. So if you have any suggestions of tips for the new version; please let me know! I would appreciate it! :) You can send me an email, drop them in the [comments on my blog](http://dirkgroenen.nl/projects/2015-08-16/mopidy-mopify-version-two/) or put them in an issue.
