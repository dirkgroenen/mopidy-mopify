Mopify is a web client for [Mopidy](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy). Instead
of most other Mopidy web clients, Mopify aims to provide a complete music
experience.

Some of the features that are included in Mopify:

- Discover the newest releases and featured playlists.
- Get music recommendations based on the music you've listened to.
- **Manage your Spotify Library (playlists, artists, albums, songs)**
- Start music stations from artists, albums, tracks, playlists or your personal
  taste profile.
- [Synchronize](https://github.com/dirkgroenen/mopidy-mopify/wiki/Services#sync) with other Mopify clients in your network
- Automatic updating
- Improved [Queue manager](https://github.com/dirkgroenen/mopidy-mopify/wiki/Queuemanager) which works like Spotify's one

## Getting started

To get started with Mopify, check out the
[Wiki](https://github.com/dirkgroenen/mopidy-mopify/wiki).

or Chrome) to access it using your server IP and Mopidy web port. For example:
`http://192.168.1.2:6680/mopify/`.

## Developing

Nodejs, Grunt and Bower are development dependencies of Mopify. You'll need to
install these programs in order to build and contribute to Mopify.

### How to Develop

Before you can start developing, you'll have to install some programs and clone
the repo to your local machine.

1. Install Nodejs
2. Install grunt-cli and bower: `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`
3. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:dirkgroenen/mopidy-mopify.git`
4. Install dependencies: `npm install && bower install`

You're now ready to start developing. To start the build, watch process and a
web server run:

```bash
grunt watch
```

This will start a web server running on port `8000`.

When you change the files in the `/src/` directory, grunt will automatically
rebuild and lint the project.

### Deploy

When you want to deploy your changed version, you have to run `grunt package`.
This will create a new `Mopidy-Mopify` web extension package.

## Changelog

See the [./CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for a list of all changes during version upgrades.
